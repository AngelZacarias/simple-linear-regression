Simple linear regression in java.

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$

## How to Run 1
To run a simple command line program you must run just the SLR class.

## How to Run 2
If you want to run the JADE solution you must:
1. Compile the SLRAgent and SLRGui both at the same time (because they have dependencies to each other).
2. Run the SLRAgent by cmd inside the jade installation path.
3. Run the agent from  the jade gui inside the Main Container.
